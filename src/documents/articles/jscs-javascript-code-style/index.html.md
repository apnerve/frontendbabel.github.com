I began to develop JSCS a year ago and did not expect it to become a robust tool, which is unique and used by such famous
teams like [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and
[Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js).
By now, at the moment of publishing this article, my project`s repository has gained over 1400 stars and I am vary glad
to realize how many people were enabled to make their work more comfortable by my product.

This project originated in my own pain.
